## Running Locally
	* Install dependencies: `npm install`
	* Start server and client with Docker in another terminal: `docker-compose up`
	* Run tests: `npx playwright test`
	* View test report: `npx playwright show-report`	

## Running Tests in CI
	* Tests run automatically on push using GitHub Actions.
	* Results are stored as:
	  * playwright-report/ (HTML)
		
## Test Coverage
	* Video playback (play, pause, seek, scroll)
	* Event data validation
	* Handling of bad/missing POST requests
	* Validate No console errors

## CI/CD
	* GitHub Actions pipeline:
	  * Builds app
	  * Starts backend
	  * Runs tests
	  * Exports results in HTML
	  
## Tech Stack
	* Playwright
	* Node.js (Express)
	* Docker
	* GitHub Actions

## Features
	* Automates user interactions with an HTML5 video player.
	* Validates backend event tracking via POST `/api/event` endpoint.
	* Handles both valid and invalid requests (negative tests).
	* Captures screenshots on test failures.
	* Generates HTML test reports.
	* CI pipeline powered by GitHub Actions.
	
## Test Plan	
	* See docs/test-plan.md for test coverage and strategy.
